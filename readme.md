### SchemaGPT lab

The idea behind this project is to build a server which can be read and written to by anyone using a [pulic custom GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-hz1nSk4cK-go-backend-api). This allows for a Wikipedia style knowledge encyclopedia (for animal data) to build up as people interact with the chatbot  â€“ without ever having to upload to the server themselves.

- The Go server is hosted at https://schema-gpt.onrender.com.

- The link to the OpenAI GPT is [Go Backend API](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-hz1nSk4cK-go-backend-api).

- Check out the API schema at https://schema-gpt.onrender.com/schema.
